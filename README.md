# Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

## Overview

This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify different groups of customers who exhibit similar purchasing behavior, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies and improving customer retention.

## Features

- **Customer Segmentation:** Group customers into clusters based on their purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and recency of their last purchase.
- **Visualization:** Display clusters in a 2D plot for easy interpretation.
- **Data Export:** Save the clustered data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:
- **CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender:** Gender of the customer.
- **Age:** Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$):** Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100):** Score assigned by the store based on customer behavior and spending.
